PDF files may contain a variety of content besides flat text and graphics including logical structuring elements, 
interactive elements such as annotations and form-fields, layers, rich media (including video content), three-dimensional 
objects using U3D or PRC, and various other data formats. The PDF specification also provides for encryption and 
digital signatures, file attachments, and metadata to enable workflows requiring these features.
